# Exploratory Data Analysis on Automobile Dataset

>Import relevant libraries and define settings for plotting.
>Data cleaning
>Missing Datafill
missing data of normalised-losses, price, horsepower, peak-rpm, bore, stroke with the respective column mean Fill missing data category Number of doors with the mode of the column.
>Replace the non-number value to null and convert the datatype.

>Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. “Uni” means “one”, so in other words your data has only one variable. 
It doesn't deal with causes or relationships (unlike regression ) and it's major purpose is to describe; It takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data.

>Bivariate Analysis¶
Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative (statistical) analysis. It involves the analysis of two variables (often denoted as X, Y), 
for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them.

>Scatter plot of price and engine size

>Normalized losses based on body style and no. of doors¶
Findings: As we understand the normalized loss which is the average loss payment per insured vehicle is calculated with many features of the cars which includes
>body style and no. of doors. Normalized losses are distributed across different body style but the two door cars has more number of losses than the four door cars.
